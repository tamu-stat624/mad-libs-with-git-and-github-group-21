Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Jason,


I am writing to you from a fancy spaceship in a tiny galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a pink rocket in August. There are 19 boys and shoes of monkey here! In the
den there is a pool full of acid. I fall asleep each night on a gorgeous bed of
steel and dream of flying ferociously. It feels as though I have lived here for
23 milliseconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
scubadiving on a infamous skateboard!!

Best wishes,
